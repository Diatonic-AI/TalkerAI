- Multi-factor authentication support
- OAuth2/OIDC integration for external services

#### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest using AES-256
- TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- HashiCorp Vault for secret management
- Data classification and handling policies

#### Infrastructure Security
- Container security with non-root users
- Kubernetes security policies and network segmentation
- Regular security scanning and vulnerability assessments
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with security validation

#### API Security
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- API versioning and deprecation policies
- Comprehensive audit logging

### üîç Security Monitoring

We continuously monitor for:
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Security vulnerability disclosures
- Container and dependency vulnerabilities
- Infrastructure security events

### üöÄ Deployment Security

#### Development Environment
- Isolated development environments
- Vault-managed secrets with limited scope
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Code review requirements for security-sensitive changes

#### Production Environment
- Zero-trust network architecture
- Automated secret rotation
- Real-time security monitoring and alerting
- Disaster recovery and incident response procedures

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

### What We Promise

1. **No Legal Action**: We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:
   - Report vulnerabilities in good faith
   - Do not access user data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
   - Do not disrupt our services or harm our users

2. **Recognition**: We will publicly acknowledge researchers who report valid vulnerabilities (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)

3. **Communication**: We will keep you informed about our progress in addressing the vulnerability

### What We Ask

1. **Privacy**: Do not access, modify, or delete user data
2. **Disclosure**: Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've had a chance to fix it
3. **Disruption**: Do not disrupt our services or degrade user experience
4. **Scope**: Focus on our in-scope systems and applications

### Bug Bounty Program

We are planning to launch a bug bounty program with the following scope:

#### In Scope
- **Primary Applications**:
  - Talk++ API servers (api.talk-plus-plus.com)
  - Web frontend (app.talk-plus-plus.com)
  - Desktop application
  - Mobile applications (when released)

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Authentication systems
  - Database interfaces
  - Container deployments
  - API gateways

#### Out of Scope
- Third-party services and integrations
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security
- Denial of service attacks
- Spam or social media abuse

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### üîí Code Security Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Authentication**: Never hardcode credentials or API keys
3. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
4. **Logging**: Log security events but never log sensitive data
5. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities

### üìã Pre-commit Checklist

Before committing code, ensure:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information

- **Container security scanning**
- **Infrastructure security validation**

## Incident Response

### üö® Security Incident Classification

#### Incident Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: Active data breach, complete service outage
- **P1 (High)**: Limited data exposure, significant service degradation
- **P2 (Medium)**: Security control failure, minor service impact
- **P3 (Low)**: Policy violation, no immediate impact

### Response Team
- **Incident Commander**: Overall incident coordination
- **Security Lead**: Security analysis and containment
- **Engineering Lead**: Technical remediation
- **Communications Lead**: Internal and external communications
- **Legal/Compliance**: Regulatory and legal considerations

### Response Procedures
